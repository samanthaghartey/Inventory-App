** Inventory Tracker App**

Hello!

I am excited to present my Inventory Tracker App, developed using Flutter, designed to help users manage their inventories super easily. This app allows for tracking, updating, and organizing items, making it perfect for personal or small business use. It includes features such as an intuitive user interface, item categorization, and a streamlined process for adding or removing items from your inventory.

### **Purpose:**
The purpose of this app is to help users efficiently track and manage their inventory, whether for a personal collection or business purposes. The app allows for easy categorization and provides users with an overview of what items they have on hand and their quantities.

### **Major Functions:**
- **Add Item**: Allows users to input new inventory items, along with descriptions and quantities.
- **Update Item**: Users can edit existing items to change quantities or other details.
- **Remove Item**: Easily delete items from the inventory when they are no longer needed.
- **Search/Filter**: Quickly locate specific items using search functionality and filters.
- **Item Categories**: Categorize items for easy access and organization.
- **Add to Shopping List**: Add items to a shopping list adn have the total cost of the items you wish to buy calculated.

### **Dependencies:**
- **Flutter**: For app development.
- **Hive Database**: For local storage of inventory data.
- **Provider**: For state management within the app.

### **Build/Deploy Instructions:**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/inventory-tracker-app.git
   ```
2. Install Flutter if you havenâ€™t already: [Flutter Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd inventory-tracker-app
   ```
4. Run the app using Flutter:

   ```

This app provides a simple yet powerful way to manage inventory, and I am continuously working to improve it with new features.
